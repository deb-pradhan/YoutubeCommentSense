# YoutubeCommentSense
A fun project that fetches YouTube comments and perform sentiment analysis on the same.
It is a fairly simple project written in python and uses YouTube data v3 api for fetching the comments and parallel dots api for sentiment analysis.
Follow these steps to make the project work.
step 1: open the dummy.py file and install all the required modules. After installing the modules, you may run the file to check if the modules are installed correctly. If found no errors, you are good to go.
step 2: Just run the CommentSense.py file. This is the actual file which does all the magic. It would ask you to search for a video title or id and the number of search results you want.(The time taken to process will vary depending on the number of comments on a video and the number of search results)
step 3: A comment.csv file will be created automatically in the directory where the commentsense.py file is located. This file can be opened in excel sheet for a good view of video title, video id and the comments.
step 4: Running this file will give a detailed reult of the sentiment analysis performed on the comments.
